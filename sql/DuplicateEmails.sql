/*
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.

Create table If Not Exists Person (id int, email varchar(255));
Truncate table Person;
insert into Person (id, email) values ('1', 'a@b.com');
insert into Person (id, email) values ('2', 'c@d.com');
insert into Person (id, email) values ('3', 'a@b.com');

-- slow solution
SELECT DISTINCT p1.email as Email FROM Person p1, Person p2 
WHERE p1.id <> p2.id AND
      p1.email = p2.email;

-- another aproach also slow
SELECT p.email AS email FROM Person p
GROUP BY p.email 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- another aproach also slow
SELECT DISTINCT p1.email AS email FROM Person p1
INNER JOIN Person p2
WHERE p1.id <> p2.id AND p1.email = p2.email;
